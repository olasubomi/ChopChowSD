    "meal_name": "Semolina Fufu",
    "meal_preparation_summary": "In this video, you'll learn how to make the perfect lump-free semolina fufu. The process involves making a slurry from semolina and water, cooking it to form a smooth base, and then adding more semolina bit by bit while stirring continuously. The fufu is cooked to the desired texture and consistency, ensuring it's neither too hard nor too soft. Finally, hot water is added back to complete the cooking process, resulting in a delicious, smooth semolina fufu.",
